# Objective

As an input, [BASiCS](https://github.com/catavallejos/BASiCS)
requires the input number of spike-in molecules per cell,
which may be calculated as described in the
[BASiCS tutorial](#https://github.com/catavallejos/TutorialBASiCS)
(*./Material/TutorialBASiCS2016.html*):

\begin{equation*} \mu_{i} = C_i \times 10^{-18} \times (6.022 \times 10^{23})
\times V \times D \hspace{0.5cm} \mbox{where,} \end{equation*}

* $C_i$ is the concentration of the spike $i$ in the ERCC mix
* $10^{-18}$ is to convert aM (attomolar) to M (molar)
* $6.022 \times 10^{23}$ is the Avogadro number (molecules per mole)
* $V$ is the volume added into each well, here $10\mu{L}$
* $D$ is a dilution factor, here $1:100,000,000$

# Concentrations in ERCC Mix from the manufacturer

Let us import the concentration of individual spike-in molecules
from the *ThermoFisher*
[website](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/4456739):

```{r mixC}
mixC <- read.table(
  "expdata/cms_095046.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t",
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
  )[,c("ERCC.ID","concentration.in.Mix.1..attomoles.ul.")]
rownames(mixC) <- mixC$ERCC.ID
colnames(mixC) <- c("ID","Concentration_attomoles_ul")
datatable(
  mixC,
  options = list(pageLength = 10, searching = TRUE), filter = "top",
  rownames = FALSE
)
```

# Number of individual ERCC molecules added to each cell

Let us calculate from the manufacturer's information and our experimental
protocol:

```{r ERCCmolecules}
mixC$ERCCmolecules <-
  mixC$Concentration_attomoles_ul *
  10^-18 *
  6.022 * 10^23 *
  10 *
  10^-8
```

We may then display the expected count of ERCC Spike-In injected at various
levels in each sample; vertical dashed lines indicate levels of **1**,
**10**, **100**, and **1,000** molecules:

```{r ERCCplotCount, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(mixC) + geom_histogram(aes(ERCCmolecules)) + scale_x_log10() +
  xlab("Number of molecules injected in sample") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 10^(0:3), colour = "red", linetype = "dashed")
```

We may also examine the count individual ERCC Spike-In expected
above different thresholds of $molecules / well$:

```{r threshold_ERCC}
datatable(data.frame(
  "log10(molecules per well)" = 10^(0:3),
  ERCC = sapply(0:3, function(x){sum(mixC$ERCCmolecules > 10^x)}),
  check.names = FALSE
  ), rownames = FALSE)
```

<!-- As HTML pages are built independently, objects need to be saved to disk
and imported as needed by the other R mardown files -->

```{r save_sce.pass, include=FALSE}
saveRDS(mixC, "rds/mixC.rds")
```
