# Introduction

This
[R Markdown Website](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/rmarkdown_websites.html)
presents a single-cell RNA-sequencing experiment and analysis of
dendritic cells following *Salmonella* infection.

# Background

_Salmonella_ Typhimurium (STM) is generally responsible for localized,
self-limiting, gastroenteritis in humans.
However, the multi-drug resistant _S._ Typhimurium ST313 pathovar has emerged
across sub-Saharan Africa as a major cause of lethal bacteremia in children and
HIV-infected adults.
The isolate STM-D23580 is a representative blood-stream clinical isolate from
a Malawian child, and demonstrates genome degradation resembling that of the
human restricted pathogen _S._ Typhi.
Dendritic cells (DCs) play an essential role in the initiation and establishment
of antigen-specific immune responses.
Modulation of DC functions by _Salmonella_ has been reported as a mechanism to
avoid adaptive immunity.
Studies aimed at elucidating the interaction between invasive _Salmonella_
and human DCs yielded important insights,
yet they are limited by population-level measurements that mask fundamental
differences among individual cells.

# Method & Results

We combined single-cell RNA-sequencing technology with fluorescent labelling of bacteria
to monitor gene expression variation among otherwise seemingly identical cells
with regard to their infection condition.
We quantified the early time course of gene expression induced by STM-LT2 or
STM-D23580 infection in 373 human monocyte-derived dendritic cells. 
We demonstrated that transcriptional profiles could distinguish between different
cellular infection phenotypes:

*	One set of genes (involving the NF-kB signalling pathway with concomitant
  chemokine and cytokine production) responded simply to exposure to extracellular bacteria.
*	Meanwhile, a different set of genes enriched for antigen presentation and
  proteolytic processes was markedly induced in _Salmonella_ containing cells.
*	Moreover, we found that gene expression heterogeneity between cells stimulated
  by extracellular or intracellular cues was increased during stimulation with invasive STM-D23580.
*	Finally, we speculate that, in a subset of infected cells, STM-D23580 may
  impair the costimulatory signalling pathway by induction of _IL10_ and
  subversion of the _CD83_/_MARCH1_ axis. 
 

# Conclusion

Our data suggest that STM-D23580 strain may shape a different cellular environment
in order to facilitate immune evasion.
To our knowledge, this is the first single-cell RNA-sequencing study carried out
in human DCs to provide new insights into the molecular contest at the
_Salmonella_-host interface and suggest new areas of research to understand the
mechanisms of invasive _Salmonella_ infection.
