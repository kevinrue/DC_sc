# Resources

## [GitHub](https://github.com)

The source code for this project is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/kevinrue/DC_sc)

## High-throughput sequencing (HTS)

### [Trim Galore!](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore)

A wrapper script to automate quality and adapter trimming as well as quality
control.

### [FastQC](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/)

A simple way to perform quality control checks on raw sequence data coming from
HTS pipelines.

### [MultiQC](http://multiqc.info)

Aggregate results from bioinformatics analyses across many samples into a
single report.

### [HISAT2](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/hisat2)

A fast and sensitive alignment program for mapping HTS reads (both DNA and RNA)
to a population of human genomes (as well as to a single reference genome).

### [featureCounts](http://bioinf.wehi.edu.au/featureCounts)

A highly efficient general-purpose read summarization program that counts
mapped reads for genomic features such as genes, exons, promoter, gene bodies,
genomic bins and chromosomal locations.

### [Ensembl](http://www.ensembl.org/index.html)

A genome browser for vertebrate
genomes that supports research in comparative genomics, evolution, sequence
variation and transcriptional regulation.

For this analysis the following data was obtained from the
[Ensembl FTP (release 86)](http://www.ensembl.org/info/data/ftp/index.html)
server:

  + Homo sapiens genome build, primary assembly sequence
  + Genomic feature annotations
  
  
### [ThermoFisher](https://www.thermofisher.com)

Supplier of analytical instruments, lab equipment and specialty diagnostics.
For this analysis, the following information was obtained from the product
web page:

  + [ERCC RNA Spike-In Mix](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/4456739):
    sequences, annotations, and concentrations

## [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org)

This community project provides tools for the analysis and comprehension of
high-throughput genomic data. 

### [edgeR](http://bioconductor.org/packages/edgeR)

Differential expression analysis of RNA-seq expression profiles with biological
replication. Used here to import raw counts for all samples (including
bulks, blanks, and single cells).

### [scater](http://bioconductor.org/packages/scater)

A collection of tools for doing various analyses of single-cell RNA-seq gene
expression data, with a focus on quality control.

### [scran](http://bioconductor.org/packages/scran)

Implements a variety of low-level analyses of single-cell RNA-seq data.
Methods are provided for normalization of cell-specific biases, assignment of
cell cycle phase, and detection of highly variable and significantly correlated
genes.

### [scde](http://bioconductor.org/packages/scde)

The `scde` package implements a set of statistical methods for analysing
single-cell RNA-seq data. `scde` fits individual error models for single-cell
RNA-seq measurements. These models can then be used for assessment of
differential expression between groups of cells, as well as other types of
analysis.

## [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com)

This interactive website was created as an
[R Markdown Website](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/rmarkdown_websites.html)

## [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/)

A network of ftp and web servers around the world that store identical, up-to-date, versions of code and documentation for `R`.

### [ggplot2](http://ggplot2.org)

A plotting system for R, based on the grammar of graphics.

## Independent R packages

### [BASiCS](https://github.com/catavallejos/BASiCS)

An integrated Bayesian hierarchical model where:

* Cell-specific normalization constants are estimated as part of the model
  parameters.
* Technical variability is quantified based on spike-in genes that are
  artificially introduced to each analysed cells lysate.
* The total variability of the expression counts is decomposed into technical
  and biological components.
  
### [SCPattern](https://github.com/lengning/SCPattern)

Identify and characterize expression changes in a single cell RNA-seq
experiment with ordered conditions.

### [WaveCrest](https://github.com/lengning/WaveCrest)

Reconstruct gene expression trajectory in single cell RNA-seq experiments with
ordered conditions.
