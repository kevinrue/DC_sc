# Overview of feature detection levels

Having selected single cells that pass all quality control criteria in the
previous sections, let us identify features that are robustly detected across
single cells in the data set.
Indeed, features detected in a small count of cells, or expressed at very
low levels carry limited information for differential expression analyses;
moreover, those features negatively affect the performance of normalisation
algorithms, due to the large number of dropout (*i.e.*, zero count) events
[@67; @Brennecke_2013].

## Counts per million (CPM)

First, let us initalise the matrix of CPM:

```{r cpm}
assay(sce.mini, "cpm") <- edgeR::cpm(counts(sce.mini))
range(colSums(assay(sce.mini, "cpm")))
```

**Note:**
The `SingleCellExperiment::cpm` method is an *accessor* to the corresponding slot of
`SingleCellExperiment` objects, while the `edgeR::cpm` method *calculates* normalised
counts per million (CPM) for given a matrix of read counts.
Furthermore, in the absence of _size factors_, CPM are computed using the
total count of read (*i.e.*, library size) for each sample,
without further normalisation of library sizes between samples.

# Selection of detected features {#selectFeatures}

In the context of the present multifactorial experimental design,
it is expected that many genes display detectable expression levels in
only a subset of experimental conditions (*e.g.*, genes induced upon bacterial stimuli or time-dependent).

Consequently, let us define informative endogenous features as those
that display an average expression level above an expression threshold
of **10** counts per million (CPM) in at least
at least **1** experimental group (3 replicate per group).

First, let us obtain---for each feature---the average expression level within
each group:

```{r avgCPMbyGroup}
avgCPMbyGroup <- apply(
  assay(sce.mini, "cpm")[!isSpike(sce.mini, "ERCC"),],
  1,
  function(x){
  tapply(x, sce.mini$Group, "mean")
})
avgCPMbyGroup <- reshape2::melt(
  avgCPMbyGroup, varnames = c("Group", "Feature"), value.name = "AvgCPM")
avgCPMbyGroup[,c("Time","Infection","Status")] <-
  limma::strsplit2(avgCPMbyGroup$Group, "_")
```

Let us then define the count of groups in which each gene is detected
at a average above **10** CPM:

```{r groupsOver10CPM}
genesOver10CPM <- with(
  avgCPMbyGroup,
  tapply(AvgCPM, Feature, function(x){sum(x > 10) >= 1})
)
```

Let us now retain for further analysis:

* endogenous features detected above **10** CPM in
  at least **1** experimental group of cells

```{r detectedFeatures}
detectedFeatures <- names(which(genesOver10CPM))
```

```{r keep}
keepEndogenous <- (rownames(sce.mini) %in% detectedFeatures) &
  (!isSpike(sce.mini, "ERCC"))
table(keepEndogenous)
```

Finally, we may extract detected features
(endogenous and ERCC spike-in molecules) into a new `SCESet`:

```{r sce.filtered}
sce.filtered <- sce.mini[keepEndogenous,]
dim(sce.filtered)
```
